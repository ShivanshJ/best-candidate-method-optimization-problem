# Best Candidate Method

Writing a dynamic programming solution for the Best Candidate Method for solving optimization problems. The goal is to minimize the computation time to get the optimal solution. An efficient program is built using Memoization.

The details of this method are given in the Powerpoint presentation and the research paper.
